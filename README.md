# CustomModLogos

***Please think ~~twice~~ at least four times about the custom mod logos you use. Don't do anything with this that you wouldn't want to share with others from families and communities you're a part of.*** *I may not be able to stop you, but I can absolutely be held free of liability if you do something stupid while using this mod.*

*Note: This mod only applies custom logos to mods already installed onto your device, and only in the "Installed" tab when viewing the Geode UI.*

Want to change a Geode mod's logo, but never figured out how without editing the raw Geode mod file itself?

(Yes, I'm looking over there at BetterEdit's logo changing shapes and colors for the `NaN`th time.)

Store your custom mod icons in this mod's config directory, and name your `.png` files according to this format:

> `{mod ID}.png`

For example, to edit the logo for this mod, simply name your `.png` file as follows:

> `raydeeux.custommodlogos.png`
